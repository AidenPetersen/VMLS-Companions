# VMLS-Python-and-Julia-Companion
*This is a companion to the Julia companion for:
"Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares" by Boyd and Vandenberghe. 

You can find notebooks with implementations in both Python and Julia that are direct references to the companion.

This is best perused in conjunction to the first degree companion: vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls-julia-companion.pdf, also provided in this repo. 

To-do:
1. Create LaTex content for the Python notebooks, the way the Julia notebooks have.
2. Create notebooks for the Prologue and Appendix.
