# VMLS-Python-and-Julia-Companion
*This is a companion to the Julia companion for:
"Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares" by Boyd and Vandenberghe. Which you can find here: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/.

You can find notebooks with implementations in both Python and Julia that are direct references to the companion.

This is best perused in conjunction to the first degree companion: http://vmls-book.stanford.edu/vmls-julia-companion.pdf.

### To-do:
1. Create informative content for the Python notebooks, the way the Julia notebooks have.
2. Create notebooks for the Prologue and Appendix.
3. Instructions about how to setup a Julia kernel for Jupyter Notebooks. For now please refer to [this](https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/) reference.
